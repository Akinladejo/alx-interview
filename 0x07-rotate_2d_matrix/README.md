# Rotate 2D Matrix

This project is a Python implementation of an algorithm that rotates an `n x n` 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix is modified in place, meaning no additional space is used to create a new matrix.

## Description

The task is to rotate a given `n x n` matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in place. The solution involves:
1. Transposing the matrix, which converts rows into columns.
2. Reversing each row of the transposed matrix to complete the 90-degree rotation.
