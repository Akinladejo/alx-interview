## Description
The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a target number of characters starting from a single character. The operations allowed are:
1. Copy All: Copies all characters to the clipboard.
2. Paste: Pastes the characters from the clipboard.

## Concepts and Resources
To solve this problem efficiently, the following concepts are utilized:
- **Dynamic Programming**: [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)
- **Prime Factorization**: [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x23f8a8c1:factoring/x23f8a8c1:prime-factorization/v/prime-factorization)
- **Code Optimization**: [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-code-optimization-tips/)
- **Greedy Algorithms**: [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/)
- **Basic Python Programming**: [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should be documented
- Code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Installation
To set up the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minimum_operations.git
    cd minimum_operations
    ```
2. Ensure you have Python 3.4.3 installed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Usage
To run the script, use the following command:
```bash
./min_operations.py
